// Appllied on the sorted array.
// Binary Search is basically used for searching an element is the nlogn time complexity. In binary search firstly we check the element in the mid then if it is not that, we check whether the ele is greater than or smaller than mid ele, then we divide the array in half accordingly. 
// In every iteration search space is decreasing to half. 
// Search Space should be Monotonic in nature. (either ascending or descending sorted array)
// By identifing the monotonic search space we can decrease the complexity from O(n^2) to O(nlogn) By utilization of Binary Search.
