//  Moore’s Voting Algorithm:
//  Approach: 
// 1. Initialize 2 variables:
//    Count –  for tracking the count of element
//    Element – for which element we are counting
// 2. Traverse through the given array.
//    -> If Count is 0 then store the current element of the array as Element.
//    -> If the current element and Element are the same increase the Count by 1.
//    -> If they are different decrease the Count by 1.
// 3. The integer present in Element should be the result we are expecting
